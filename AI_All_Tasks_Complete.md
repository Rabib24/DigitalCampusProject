## System Capabilities

The AI system now provides:

1. **Intelligent Course Recommendations**
   - Personalized course suggestions using hybrid filtering
   - Match scoring with detailed reasoning
   - User feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement

2. **Academic Performance Prediction**
   - Predictive models for estimating course performance
   - Risk assessment for identifying at-risk students
   - Confidence scoring for prediction reliability
   - Actionable insights for academic support

3. **Intelligent Search**
   - Natural language processing for query understanding
   - Advanced filtering by type, department, credits, and relevance
   - Relevance ranking of search results
   - Cached responses for improved performance

## Privacy and Security

The system maintains full compliance with:
- Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- Institutional data governance policies

Security features include:
