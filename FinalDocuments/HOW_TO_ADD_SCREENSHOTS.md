## Step 3: Update the Script

I'll create an updated script that will:
- Keep the AI-generated images as backups
- Use your real screenshots if available
- Fall back to AI-generated images if real ones aren't found

## Alternative: Share Screenshots with Me

If you want me to help process your screenshots:

1. Take the screenshots as described above
2. Save them anywhere on your computer
3. Tell me the file paths, and I can:
   - Copy them to the Imgs folder
   - Rename them appropriately
   - Update the chapter references

## Current Image References in Chapters

**Chapter 06:**
- `Imgs/system_architecture_overview.png` (AI-generated - can keep this)

**Chapter 07:**
- `Imgs/faculty_dashboard_mockup.png` → Replace with `faculty_dashboard_real.png`
- `Imgs/student_dashboard_mockup.png` → Replace with `student_dashboard_real.png`
- `Imgs/enrollment_workflow_diagram.png` (AI-generated - can keep this)
- `Imgs/analytics_dashboard_charts.png` → Replace with `analytics_real.png`
- `Imgs/mobile_responsive_design.png` (AI-generated - can keep this)

## Tips for Good Screenshots

1. **Use Full Screen**: Maximize your browser for cleaner screenshots
2. **Hide Personal Info**: Blur or crop any sensitive student/faculty data
3. **Good Lighting**: Make sure the screen is clearly visible
4. **High Resolution**: Use at least 1920x1080 resolution
5. **Show Key Features**: Make sure important UI elements are visible

## Let Me Know

Just tell me:
- Where your screenshots are saved (file paths)
- Which ones you want to replace

I'll handle the rest!
