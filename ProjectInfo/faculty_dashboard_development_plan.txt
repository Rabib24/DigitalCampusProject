Faculty Dashboard Development Plan
================================

This document serves as a master reference for the Faculty Dashboard implementation.

FILES CREATED:
==============

1. FacultyDashboardTodo.txt
   Location: H:\Systemproject\DigitalCampus\FacultyDashboardTodo.txt
   Purpose: Comprehensive task list breaking down the complete faculty dashboard design into smaller components and individual pages

2. faculty_component_analysis.txt
   Location: H:\Systemproject\DigitalCampus\ProjectInfo\faculty_component_analysis.txt
   Purpose: Detailed breakdown of components needed for the faculty dashboard based on the specification

3. faculty_page_structure.txt
   Location: H:\Systemproject\DigitalCampus\ProjectInfo\faculty_page_structure.txt
   Purpose: Detailed page structure plan following the FacultyDashboard.txt specification

4. faculty_api_endpoints.txt
   Location: H:\Systemproject\DigitalCampus\ProjectInfo\faculty_api_endpoints.txt
   Purpose: Specification of all API endpoints required for the Faculty Dashboard implementation

5. faculty_implementation_roadmap.txt
   Location: H:\Systemproject\DigitalCampus\ProjectInfo\faculty_implementation_roadmap.txt
   Purpose: Phased approach roadmap for implementing the Faculty Dashboard
