Features Planning :

1 — Vision & guiding principles

Role-first UX — each persona sees only what they need (student, faculty, advisor, library staff, dept admin, finance, researcher, IT, alumni).


Faculty-controlled teaching — faculty keep control of recordings, content publishing, grading and sharing.


Privacy & safety by default — consent flows, opt-ins for sharing recordings or personal profiles, audit trails.


Offline modes for many students.


Student empowerment & recognition — portfolio, competitions, student-created features.
