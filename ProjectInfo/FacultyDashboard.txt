IUB Digital Campus - Faculty Dashboard Specification
===================================================

1. GOAL
=======
The Faculty Dashboard is the central hub for faculty members to manage their teaching responsibilities, research activities, and academic advising duties. It provides a personalized, role-based interface that allows faculty to:
- Create and manage course content
- Grade assignments and track student progress
- Record and share class sessions
- Communicate with students and colleagues
- Manage research projects and publications
- Fulfill academic advising responsibilities as student advisors
- Access administrative tools and reports

The dashboard follows the "Role-first UX" principle, showing only what faculty members need to see for an efficient and focused experience. It emphasizes "Faculty-controlled teaching" where faculty keep control of recordings, content publishing, grading, and sharing.
