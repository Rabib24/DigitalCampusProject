FACULTY DASHBOARD - DATABASE CONNECTION ERRORS
============================================

This document lists ALL pages in the faculty dashboard sidebar where data is NOT being fetched from the database, organized by severity.

CRITICAL ISSUES (Pages Using Hardcoded/Mock Data):
===================================================

1. ANNOUNCEMENTS PAGE
   File: frontend/src/app/faculty/announcements/page.tsx
   Issue: Uses hardcoded announcement data (lines 43-82)
   Missing: Database connection to fetch/create announcements
   Required Backend Endpoint: /faculty/announcements/
   Database Model: Alert model exists in communications/models.py but NOT connected
   Impact: Faculty cannot create or view real announcements to students

2. SCHEDULE PAGE
   File: frontend/src/app/faculty/schedule/page.tsx
   Issue: Uses hardcoded class session data (lines 22-53)
   Missing: Database connection to fetch faculty schedule/timetable
   Required Backend Endpoint: /faculty/schedule/ or /faculty/timetable/
   Database Model: CalendarEvent exists but NOT connected for faculty schedules
   Impact: Faculty cannot view their actual class schedule

   Database Model: NO messaging model exists
   Impact: Faculty cannot send/receive messages to students or colleagues

5. ADVISING OVERVIEW PAGE
   File: frontend/src/app/faculty/advising/page.tsx
   Issue: Uses simulated API call with hardcoded advisee data (lines 36-68)
   Missing: Real database connection (currently uses setTimeout mock)
   Backend Endpoint EXISTS: /faculty/advising/advisees/ (confirmed in urls.py)
   Issue: Frontend not calling the real API endpoint
   Impact: Faculty cannot see their actual advisees

6. APPOINTMENT SCHEDULING PAGE
   File: frontend/src/app/faculty/advising/appointments/page.tsx
   Issue: Uses hardcoded appointment and advisee data (lines 37-147)
   Missing: Database connection to fetch/create appointments
   Required Backend Endpoint: /faculty/appointments/ (CRUD operations)
   Database Model: Appointment model EXISTS in appointments/models.py but NOT connected to faculty endpoints
   Impact: Faculty cannot schedule or manage real advising appointments

7. ANALYTICS PAGE

   Issue: Frontend not calling the real API endpoint
   Impact: Faculty cannot see real analytics data

8. ADMIN - TIMETABLE MANAGEMENT PAGE
   File: frontend/src/app/faculty/admin/timetable/page.tsx
   Issue: Uses hardcoded timetable entries (lines 40-105)
   Missing: Database connection for department timetable management
   Required Backend Endpoint: /faculty/admin/timetable/
   Database Model: NO timetable model exists for course scheduling
   Impact: Faculty admins cannot manage real course schedules

9. ADMIN - STUDENT REQUESTS PAGE
   File: frontend/src/app/faculty/admin/requests/page.tsx
   Issue: Uses hardcoded student request data (lines 35-86)
   Missing: Database connection for student request approval system
   Required Backend Endpoint: /faculty/admin/requests/
   Database Model: NO student request model exists
   Impact: Faculty cannot approve/reject student course add/drop requests

10. ADMIN - COURSES PAGE
    File: frontend/src/app/faculty/admin/courses/page.tsx
    Issue: Uses hardcoded department course data (lines not read yet, confirmed from previous analysis)
    Missing: Database connection for department-wide course management
    Required Backend Endpoint: /faculty/admin/courses/
    Note: Different from /faculty/courses/ which shows only instructor's courses
    Impact: Department admins cannot manage all department courses

11. RESEARCH PAGE
    File: frontend/src/app/faculty/research/page.tsx
    Issue: Uses setTimeout mock with hardcoded research projects (lines 33-89)
    Backend Endpoint EXISTS: /faculty/research/projects/ (confirmed in urls.py)
    Issue: Frontend not calling the real API endpoint
    Impact: Faculty see mock research projects instead of their actual projects

12. RESEARCH - PROJECT DETAILS PAGE

    Issue: Uses hardcoded project details
    Backend Endpoint EXISTS: /faculty/research/projects/{id}/ (confirmed in urls.py)
    Issue: Frontend not calling the real API endpoint
    Impact: Faculty cannot view real research project details

13. PUBLICATIONS PAGE
    File: frontend/src/app/faculty/research/publications/page.tsx
    Issue: Uses hardcoded publication data (lines 40-75)
    Missing: Database connection to fetch publications
    API Functions: getFacultyPublications, createFacultyPublication exist in api.ts BUT backend endpoints DO NOT exist
    Database Model: Publication model EXISTS in publications/models.py but NOT connected to faculty endpoints
    Required Backend Endpoints:
      - GET /faculty/publications/list/
      - POST /faculty/publications/create/
      - GET /faculty/publications/{id}/
      - PUT /faculty/publications/{id}/update/

    Issue: Uses completely hardcoded IUBian student data (lines 36-610)
    Missing: Database connection to fetch faculty's IUBian/mentee students
    Required Backend Endpoint: /faculty/profile/iubians/ or /faculty/mentees/
    Database Model: Student relationships need to be tracked
    Impact: Faculty cannot see or manage their actual IUBian students


PAGES WITH PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION:
====================================

15. PROFILE PAGE
    File: frontend/src/app/faculty/profile/page.tsx
    Issue: Profile and notification settings are managed locally (no save to backend)
    Backend Endpoints EXIST: /faculty/profile/ and /faculty/settings/ (confirmed in urls.py)
    Issue: handleSaveProfile and handleSaveNotifications only console.log, don't call API
    Impact: Faculty profile and notification preferences not saved to database


PAGES WORKING CORRECTLY:
=========================

✓ Courses List - Uses getFacultyCourses() API (backend: /faculty/courses/)
✓ Assignments List - Uses getFacultyAssignments() API (backend: /faculty/assignments/)
✓ Gradebook - Uses course gradebook endpoint (backend: /faculty/courses/{id}/gradebook/)
✓ Research Grants - Uses getFacultyGrantApplications() API (backend: /faculty/grants/list/)
✓ Research Ethics - Backend endpoints exist in ethics_views.py
✓ Recordings - Uses getFacultyRecordings() API (backend: /faculty/recordings/)

   - DELETE /faculty/mentees/{student_id}/remove/
   Database Model: Need to create Mentorship or extend Student model


FRONTEND API FUNCTIONS THAT NEED BACKEND:
==========================================

These functions exist in frontend/src/lib/faculty/api.ts but have NO backend:

1. Publication Management (lines 556-631):
   - getFacultyPublications()
   - getFacultyPublicationDetail()
   - createFacultyPublication()
   - updateFacultyPublication()
   - deleteFacultyPublication()
   - searchFacultyPublications()

2. Ethics Management (lines 634-724):
   - API functions call /faculty/ethics/list/ but backend has /faculty/research/ethics/

Note: Ethics endpoints exist but path mismatch between frontend and backend


SUMMARY STATISTICS:
===================

Total Faculty Dashboard Pages Analyzed: 20+
Pages with Mock/Hardcoded Data: 14
Pages with Partial Implementation: 1
Pages Working Correctly: 5
Backend Endpoints Needed: 40+
Database Models Needed: 5 new models
Database Models Existing but Unconnected: 3 models


PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS:
==========================

HIGH PRIORITY (Core Faculty Functions):
1. Fix Advising page to call real API endpoint (backend exists, frontend not using it)
2. Fix Analytics page to call real API endpoint (backend exists, frontend not using it)
3. Fix Research page to call real API endpoint (backend exists, frontend not using it)
4. Connect Appointments system (model exists, needs backend endpoints)
5. Connect Notifications system (model exists, needs backend endpoints)
6. Fix Profile save functions to call real API endpoints (backend exists)

MEDIUM PRIORITY (Faculty Communication):
7. Create Announcements/Alerts backend endpoints (model exists)
8. Create Messaging system (needs model + backend)
9. Create Schedule/Timetable backend endpoints (needs model or use CalendarEvent)

LOW PRIORITY (Administrative Functions):
10. Create Publications backend endpoints (model exists)
11. Create Student Requests system (needs model + backend)
12. Create Department Timetable Management (needs model + backend)
13. Create IUBian/Mentee system (needs model extensions + backend)


NOTES:
======

- Many database models ALREADY EXIST but are not connected to backend endpoints
- Some backend endpoints ALREADY EXIST but frontend is not calling them (using mock data instead)
- The main issues are:
  1. Missing backend endpoint implementations
  2. Frontend pages not calling existing backend APIs
  3. Missing API endpoint definitions in urls.py
  4. Need to create a few new database models for features not yet implemented
