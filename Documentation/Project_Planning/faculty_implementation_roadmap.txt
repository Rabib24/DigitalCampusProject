2. Technical challenges - Regular code reviews and early problem identification
3. Resource constraints - Prioritize must-have features over nice-to-have
4. Integration issues - Early API testing and mock data usage
5. Performance problems - Regular performance testing and optimization

DEPENDENCIES:
============
1. Backend API endpoints must be available
2. Database models must be implemented
3. Authentication system must be functional
4. Design system components must be available
5. Third-party services (email, file storage) must be configured
