Digital Campus - Incomplete Faculty Dashboard Tasks
===============================================

The following faculty dashboard features are still not fully connected to database-backed implementations or have only placeholder data:

1. Faculty Advising
- Advising list and detail views now use real Student/Enrollment models instead of simulated data. [COMPLETED]
- API responses are aligned with the frontend `Advisee` shape while using real student/advisor relationships. [COMPLETED]

2. Research Grants and Ethics
- Grant, ethics, and collaboration views now use proper models instead of in-memory mock data. [COMPLETED]
- They are properly exposed via `faculty/urls.py` with complete CRUD operations. [COMPLETED]

3. Research Collaboration and Milestones
- Collaboration endpoints now use real faculty IDs for filtering. [COMPLETED]
- Milestone endpoints are backed by persistent models and linked to advisees/students. [COMPLETED]

4. Class Recordings
- `faculty/recordings/` now returns real data with underlying Recording model. [COMPLETED]
- Recording model is implemented and faculty recordings page is wired to real data. [COMPLETED]

5. Faculty Settings and Profile UI
- Faculty settings/profile frontend now connects to APIs so changes persist in the database. [COMPLETED]
- Settings and profile forms are connected to `faculty/settings_views` and `faculty/profile_views` APIs. [COMPLETED]

6. Dashboard Overview and Analytics
- Dashboard overview data now uses real database queries instead of placeholder values. [COMPLETED]
- Analytics data is connected to real student performance and attendance data. [COMPLETED]

7. Gradebook Implementation
- Gradebook view now has proper database integration for real student grades. [COMPLETED]
- Update grade functionality is connected to the actual Grade model. [COMPLETED]

8. Course Management
- Course list and detail views are fully connected to the Course model with real data. [COMPLETED]
- Assignment management views have database integration for real assignment data. [COMPLETED]

ALL FACULTY DASHBOARD TASKS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED. The faculty dashboard is now fully implemented with real data connections.

Student Dashboard Integration - Incomplete Items
==============================================

- Break down main student dashboard (src/app/student/page.tsx) into smaller components under src/components/student (e.g. TopNav, Sidebar, DashboardView, CoursesView, AssignmentsView, GradesView).
- Implement missing sidebar views and routes for library, calendar, messages, and settings so they render dedicated components instead of falling back to the main dashboard.
- Replace static/sample data with real data wiring (or a shared mock API layer) for:
  * Dashboard summary metrics (CGPA, completed courses, predicted graduation, attendance)
  * Courses list and course detail pages (/student/course-:id)
  * Assignments list, assignment detail, and submission pages (/student/assignment-detail-*, /student/submit-assignment-*)
  * Grades overview and detailed grades (/student/grades-detail)
- Implement additional student dashboard features from todo.txt 3.2, including (but not limited to):
  * "My IUBian" profile card (profile, skills, badges, activities)
  * Degree planning tools
  * Advisor communication and appointment scheduling components
  * Library access widgets for book catalog, loans, and digital resources (student-facing)
  * Finance widgets for tuition payment, scholarship applications, and billing history (student-facing)
  * Emergency and safety features (panic button, emergency contacts manager) within the student experience
  * Notification center / in-app notification panel connected to announcements and alerts
  * AI-related features: CGPA calculator, retake recommendation component, what-if scenario planner
- Add automated tests for student dashboard navigation (sidebar, view switching) and key detail pages (course, assignments, grades) to prevent regressions.

Faculty Dashboard Implementation - New Task
=========================================

- Implement comprehensive faculty dashboard based on FacultyDashboardTodo.txt [COMPLETED]
- Create all faculty-specific components under src/components/faculty/ [COMPLETED]
- Implement faculty dashboard pages under src/app/faculty/ [COMPLETED]
- Connect faculty dashboard to backend API endpoints [COMPLETED]
- Implement role-based access control for faculty users [COMPLETED]
- Add automated tests for faculty dashboard components and pages [PENDING]

BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION GAPS
===========================

1. Authentication & Users
- JWT Token Invalidation: `logout_view` in `backend/users/views.py` is a placeholder. Needs blacklist or expiration handling.
- SSO Integration: `sso_login` and `sso_callback` in `backend/users/sso_views.py` are mock implementations. Needs real university SSO provider integration.
- Student GPA: `calculate_gpa` in `Student` model (`backend/users/models.py`) returns `cumulative_gpa` field directly without calculation logic.
- Faculty Schedule: `get_teaching_schedule` in `Faculty` model (`backend/users/models.py`) is a placeholder.

- Unified Admin Dashboard UI is missing.
- Management UIs for Permissions, Courses, Faculty, Students, Grades are missing.
- Reporting UI with charts is missing.

- Input validation and sanitization needed for all endpoints.
- Pagination for large datasets.
- Bulk operations and audit logging.
- Data export (CSV/Excel/PDF).

3. Security & Reporting
- RBAC for admin levels.
- 2FA for admins.
- Customizable report templates and scheduled generation.
