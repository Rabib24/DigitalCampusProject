## AI Features Planned

Based on the project requirements documented in todo.txt lines 313-332, the following AI features are planned:

1. **Intelligent Course Recommendations**
   - Collaborative filtering and content-based filtering algorithms

2. **Academic Performance Prediction**
   - Early warning systems for at-risk students
   - Anomaly detection for unusual academic patterns

3. **Intelligent Search and Discovery**
   - Semantic search with sentence transformers
   - Personalized search results

4. **Automated Content Categorization**
   - Multi-modal classification for educational materials

5. **Chatbot and Virtual Assistant**
   - Intent recognition with transformer models
   - Dialog management system

6. **Enhanced Plagiarism Detection**
   - Text similarity with deep learning models

## Technical Requirements

The AI implementation will require:
- TensorFlow and PyTorch frameworks
- Hugging Face Transformers, spaCy, NLTK for NLP
- OpenCV, Pillow for computer vision
- scikit-learn for traditional machine learning
- MLflow for model versioning
- TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe for model deployment
- Weights & Biases or MLflow for experiment tracking
- Monitoring systems for performance and drift detection

## Next Steps

1. Review the implementationAI.txt document for detailed guidance
2. Use AI_TodoTasks.txt to track progress on AI implementation
3. Begin Phase 1: Foundation (AI development environment setup)
4. Establish data infrastructure and governance
5. Begin data collection and labeling processes

## Conclusion

The Digital Campus project now has a comprehensive plan for AI integration with detailed implementation guidelines and task tracking. The AI features will significantly enhance the platform's capabilities, providing personalized learning experiences, predictive analytics, and intelligent campus services.
