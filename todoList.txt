## Critical Issues to Address

3. ~~**Frontend Missing**: No UI components exist for student course enrollment~~
4. ~~**Incomplete Role-Based Features**: Faculty and administrative interfaces are missing~~

## Verification Steps Completed

### For Student Functions (Verified)
~~1. Students can only enroll during active registration periods~~
~~2. Students can browse available courses with correct information~~
~~3. Prerequisite checking works correctly~~
~~4. Schedule conflict detection prevents invalid enrollments~~
~~5. Waitlist functionality works as expected~~
~~6. Students can successfully enroll in available courses~~
~~7. Students can drop courses during allowed periods~~
~~8. Enrollment changes are properly reflected in student records~~
1. Rate limiting prevents abuse during high-concurrency periods
2. Audit logging captures all enrollment actions
3. Faculty/advisor approval workflow functions for special cases
4. Automatic section creation works during high-demand enrollment

## Next Steps
1. ~~Develop frontend UI components for student enrollment~~
2. ~~Implement faculty and administrative interfaces~~
3. ~~Add comprehensive testing for all components~~
6. ~~Add faculty/advisor approval workflow for special cases~~
7. ~~Implement automatic section creation for high-demand courses~~
