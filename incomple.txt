Student Dashboard Integration - Incomplete Items
==============================================

- Break down main student dashboard (src/app/student/page.tsx) into smaller components under src/components/student (e.g. TopNav, Sidebar, DashboardView, CoursesView, AssignmentsView, GradesView).
- Implement missing sidebar views and routes for library, calendar, messages, and settings so they render dedicated components instead of falling back to the main dashboard.
- Replace static/sample data with real data wiring (or a shared mock API layer) for:
  * Dashboard summary metrics (CGPA, completed courses, predicted graduation, attendance)
  * Courses list and course detail pages (/student/course-:id)
  * Assignments list, assignment detail, and submission pages (/student/assignment-detail-*, /student/submit-assignment-*)
  * Grades overview and detailed grades (/student/grades-detail)
- Implement additional student dashboard features from todo.txt 3.2, including (but not limited to):
  * "My IUBian" profile card (profile, skills, badges, activities)
  * Degree planning tools
  * Advisor communication and appointment scheduling components
  * Library access widgets for book catalog, loans, and digital resources (student-facing)
  * Finance widgets for tuition payment, scholarship applications, and billing history (student-facing)
  * Emergency and safety features (panic button, emergency contacts manager) within the student experience
  * Notification center / in-app notification panel connected to announcements and alerts
  * AI-related features: CGPA calculator, retake recommendation component, what-if scenario planner
- Add automated tests for student dashboard navigation (sidebar, view switching) and key detail pages (course, assignments, grades) to prevent regressions.
